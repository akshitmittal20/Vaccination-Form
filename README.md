# Vaccination-Form
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, I spearheaded the development of a vaccination registration system. This platform allowed users to input their personal information and location, facilitating the selection of a nearby vaccination center and available dates. Once submitted, the system generated a unique Vaccination Entry Form for each user.
